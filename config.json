By promoting yourself you **get access to** the following things:\n\n<:dot:1024566211209597009>Fast responding hotfixes\n<:dot:1024566211209597009>Official releases\n<:dot:1024566211209597009>Colored premium rank\n\n**How it works**\nAfter clicking on the button below, you will be asked to enter your SpigotMC user name. The bot then searches for a payment that was registered in combination with your name. If there is a match, a verification code will be generated which has to be forwarded to us via a conversation on SpigotMC. The entire process doesn't take longer than a minute!\n\n**Bought another plugin?**\nIn case you bought another plugin, you can simply update your roles by starting another promotion. You won't have to verify your SpigotMC account again if you already did that."
